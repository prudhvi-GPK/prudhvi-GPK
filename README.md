## Hi there 👋 I'm Prudhvi Krishna Gangavarapu!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Data Engineer with over 4 years of experience in designing, developing, and optimizing data pipelines, data architectures, and ETL processes. I love working with data, whether it's transforming raw data into meaningful insights or building scalable data solutions for business needs.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- **PostgreSQL + Apache Airflow ETL Project**: Building a data pipeline with Docker and Airflow to automate ETL processes.
- **Real-Time Data Pipelines**: Exploring batch and real-time data integration using Azure tools.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- **Advanced SQL** techniques by building projects using **SQL Server Management Studio**.
- **Cloud-native architectures** with **Azure** and **Google Cloud Platform**.
- Experimenting with **AI/ML Productionization** for scaling machine learning models.

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- **Open-source data engineering projects** that involve modern data pipelines, ETL, and cloud-based solutions.
- **ML/AI Productionization** projects using tools like Azure, Spark, and Docker.

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- **Scaling ETL processes** and optimizing them for real-time use cases.

### 💬 Ask me about:
- Building ETL pipelines with **Azure Data Factory** and **Informatica**.
- Data engineering using **Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Spark**.
- Cloud data engineering with **Azure** and **GCP**.
